Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This was my first time using Sass/SCSS as well as following BEM.

This was great practice and I'm quite pleased with how it turned out. Sass offers so much quality of life, this was a treat to work on.

I think I'm fully grasping the idea behind responsive design now - Took a few projects and some practice, but I think this is by far the most responsive solution I've submitted. I also added an extra layout for tablet/medium sized displays before the desktop one since the boxes looked a bit awkward without no in-between mobile and desktop.

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM

# Looking Back
- I'm not sure if I used partials properly - Is having my variables in their relevant partial okay, or should I group them all in one partial for variables?
- I think I named my classes properly according to BEM, but since this was my first time I'm not 100% sure.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
